How different can memories be about the same things? This research study will investigate the way memories are perceived and seen, through understanding how they’re manifested visually.
<p>  The information and material gathered from this website is meant to serve an academic research project only. Before you start navigating, please note that - if you choose to participate in this research project, any material you submit has to be via e-mail therefore limiting you to any anonymous confidentiality. There is the possibility for some of the drawings to be featured in a small book to be exhibited at the University of Greenwich’s Graduate Show 2020; if you’re ok with this, when submitting your drawings please state your name
For any other questions dont hesitate to contact me at margazida@icloud.com </p>
