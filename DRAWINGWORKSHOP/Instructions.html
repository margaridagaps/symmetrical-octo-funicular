<h1>
<p>This is a simple contour drawing exercise and please don't worry about your drawing skills - testing them is not the purpose of this project.
  Start by grabbing any piece of paper that is available to you (the back of a receipt, a page from a notebook or even a napkin if you can work with that).
Using only one pen or pencil, you will have to draw the subjects listed twice(!!):  </p>

<p> 1. Draw a hand</p>
<p> 2. Draw a fruit that you have at home</p>
<p> 3. Draw one thing you're going to eat today</p>
<p> 4. Do a self-portrait</p>

<p>Do the first set of drawings how you would normally. You don't have to look at the subjects - just draw the subjects how you imagine them to be.
The second time you do them, you will be doing a blind contour drawing. This means that you'll have to be actively looking at the subject that you want to draw and can't look down at the paper while you're doing so. I'ts very important to not look down at the drawing that you're making! This will help with the empirical experience that this project investigates. Use the same subjects for both sets. </p>
